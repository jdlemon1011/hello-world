# hello-world
My new and first repository.
This is my first attempt at doing anything within GitHub.  
I'm currently working through the tutorial and therefore, this page exists.  I am a student at 
Arizona State University, and brand new to software development.  This will be my third degree overall; 
my second undergrad degree.  I look forward to learning more about this immersive world and interacting with 
many of the other programmers out there.
